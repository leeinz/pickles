</style>Hi, I'm Liana. I'm a 25 year old competitive home-pickler located in the NYC area. The pictures and information you'll find here are my own. I've spent the past three years perfecting the art of brining, immersing, and sterilizing so I can show you how to safely maked delicious & nutritious pickled goods in your home. Good luck! (And don't forget the garlic!)

Pickling is rumored to have begun over 4,000 using cucumbers native to India. The word "pickle" as we know it is derived from the Dutch word <em>pickel,</em> which means brine.  When making pickles, we are talking about the way in which we use brine or an immersion in vinegar to preserve or expand the lifespan of food.
