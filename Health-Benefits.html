<h1>Pickles: The Perfect Food</h1>
</center>
<center>
<p>Western Pickles, or sour cucumber pickles contain iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and sodium. Additionally, it includes vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folates, vitamin B-12, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, and vitamin K.</p>

<center><h2><bold>A Probiotic Paradise:</bold></h2></center>
<p>Probiotic bacteria are bacteria that are present in our digestive system. These bacteria help us to digest and break down food. Occasionally, due to antibiotics and invading bacteria these friendly bacteria are killed. When their numbers fall, digestive issues can occur. These issues can be resolved by eating fermented pickles. 
Naturally fermented salt pickles encourage the growth of friendly bacteria which replenish their numbers and restore health. The kimchi I made, pictured below, is an excellent source of vitamins and probiotics due to fermentation.</p>

<center><h2><bold>Antioxidants:</h2></bold></center>
<p>Pickles tend to be a good source of antioxidants, or micronutrients that protect the body from free radical attacks. Free radicals are unstable chemicals which are produced during cellular metabolism. These unstable chemicals react with our cells and damage our DNA to create more and more free radicals.
 As the vegetables and/or under-ripe fruits are stored without cooking, the antioxidants present in those food items are preserved as is. We can protect ourselves from free radicals by consuming foods high in antioxidants like pickles.</p>
<center><h2><bold>Diabetes Control:</h2></bold></center>
<p>Diabetes is a health epidemic which concerns the body’s ability to use glucose normally. Studies have shown the consumption of vinegar-based pickles improves hemoglobin levels in people with diabetes, which helps them control their diabetes. The acetic acid present in vinegar is credited for this medical phenomenon. Please see the below image of pickled red onions made with vinegar.</p>

<center><h2><em>However...</h2></em></center>
<center><p>Pickles <em>do</em> contain excess salt which can increase blood pressure!</p></center>
